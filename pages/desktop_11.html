        If you never see a doctor, you can’t ever have a relationship with one. On the other hand, having a regular physician means having someone who knows the intricacies of your medical history and who will work with you to shape your healthy present and future. Many people I know have had a bad experience with hospitals or doctors and now avoid institutions of health at all costs—including their own health. But while not every doctor is going to be the right one for you, you owe it to yourself to keep looking until you find a practitioner that you like and trust.

        Reasons to Consult a doctor include
        <p>Do you ever wonder how you went from wearing a size 6 to a size 10 in what seems like the blink of an eye, but what was really over the course of months or years? Many of my new patients who haven’t seen a doctor in years are shocked when they step on the scale and learn that they have gained 20-plus pounds since they were last weighed. And even if you still fit into your skinny jeans, there are other health markers, like heart rate and blood pressure, that should be trended over time. By monitoring basic vital signs, a routine doctor’s visit can be like a system of checks and balances for your body.</p>
